## ‧₊˚ ┊ Overview  
**CampusKonek** is a console-based Java application designed to help universities manage students and organizations efficiently.  
<br/>
It showcases strong application of **Object-Oriented Programming principles**, including abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, combined with proper input handling, modular design, and logically structured menus.

It allows seamless interaction between Admins and Students through login systems and multiple CRUD operations for student and organization management.

- Manage organization status  

🎓 **Students:**  
- Log in using personal credentials  
- View profile  
- Browse approved organizations  
- Apply for an organization  
- Update personal details
